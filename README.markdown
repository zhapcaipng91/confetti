# Affiliate Marketplace Platform

This project aims to build an affiliate marketplace platform similar to the Scaleo demo (https://demo.scaleo.io/manager/dashboard), enabling affiliate partners to discover and participate in affiliate offers from advertisers, with standardized branding.

## Requirements
- **User Management**: Support for three user types: Admins (create and manage offers), Advertisers (view and track offers), and Affiliates (discover and join offers).
- **Offer Management**: Admins can create, edit, and track affiliate offers with details like commission rates, terms, and tracking links. Advertisers can only track offers.
- **Dashboard**: Intuitive dashboard for all user types, displaying key metrics (clicks, conversions, earnings, etc.).
- **Tracking System**: Real-time tracking of clicks, conversions, and commissions with anti-fraud logic to filter invalid traffic.
- **Integrations**: Seamless integration with third-party tools (e.g., Shopify, WooCommerce, Google Analytics) via API or plugins.
- **Payment System**: Support for automated commission payouts with configurable payment methods and schedules.
- **Security**: Robust user authentication, data encryption, and fraud detection to ensure platform integrity.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design for access on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive UI.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for scalable API development.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data (users, offers, transactions).
- **API**: RESTful API for third-party integrations and data transfer.
- **Hosting**: AWS (EC2, S3, RDS) for cloud-based deployment and scalability.
- **Tracking**: Custom tracking solution with Redis for real-time analytics.
- **Security**: JWT for authentication, SSL/TLS for encryption, and OWASP-compliant practices.
- **Analytics**: Integration with Google Analytics and custom reporting tools.
